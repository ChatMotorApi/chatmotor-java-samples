<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of
Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing
title, but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he
disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the
feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at
Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down
anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice
boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider Kelly's star pupil.
Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no
matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five
pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast. He was so good that
Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened. This
increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of
some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at
Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one
of his class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was
middleweight boxing champion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when
their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert
Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had
stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen
something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child, but I
finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly. Spider Kelly not only
remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the
richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the
oldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a
very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious. No one
had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else,
until he went to Princeton. He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy,
and it made him bitter. He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton
with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the
first girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children,
lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the
estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould
under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his
mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter. As
he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it
because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a
very healthful shock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the
Coast. In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a
little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of
the Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished
in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely
as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a
member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor. It was his money and
he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine
became too expensive and he had to give it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He
had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was
very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he
was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine was not going
to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as
well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so
she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write. They came to Europe,
where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three
years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two
friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his
tennis friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the
end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward
Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute
determination that he should marry her. During this time Robert's mother had
settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month. During two
years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman. He
was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would
rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing. He wrote a novel,
and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although
it was a very poor novel. He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and
boxed at a local gymnasium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I first became aware of his lady's attitude toward him one
night after the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l'Avenue's and
afterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee. We had several&nbsp;<i>fines</i>&nbsp;after
the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been talking about the two of
us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He wanted to get out of town and get
in a good walk. I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or
somewhere or other in Alsace. &quot;I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us
the town,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Somebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was
accidental and went on: &quot;She's been there two years and knows everything
there is to know about the town. She's a swell girl.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw
Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hell,&quot; I said, &quot;why go to Strasbourg? We
could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said
good-night and went out. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to
the corner with me. &quot;For God's sake,&quot; he said, &quot;why did you say
that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn't you see Frances?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No, why should I? If I know an American girl that
lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't
go, that would be all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't be silly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you
see the way she looked?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; I said, &quot;let's go to
Senlis.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't get sore.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay
at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good, that will be fine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, I'll see you to-morrow at the courts,&quot; I
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good-night, Jake,&quot; he said, and started back to
the café.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You forgot to get your paper,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's so.&quot; He walked with me up to the kiosque
at the corner. &quot;You are not sore, are you, Jake?&quot; He turned with the
paper in his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No, why should I be?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;See you at tennis,&quot; he said. I watched him walk
back to the café holding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led
him quite a life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>

<p class=MsoNormal><a

2</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel,
and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I
heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several women were
nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite changed. He was
more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was not so simple, and he was
not so nice. The publishers had praised his novel pretty highly and it rather
went to his head. Then several women had put themselves out to be nice to him,
and his horizons had all shifted. For four years his horizon had been
absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had
never seen beyond Frances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in
college, and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not
been everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he realized that
he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact of a woman caring for
him and wanting to live with him was not simply a divine miracle. This changed
him so that he was not so pleasant to have around. Also, playing for higher
stakes than he could afford in some rather steep bridge games with his New York
connections, he had held cards and won several hundred dollars. It made him
rather vain of his bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could
always make a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there was another thing. He had been reading W. H.
Hudson. That sounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread
&quot;The Purple Land.&quot; &quot;The Purple Land&quot; is a very sinister
book if read too late in life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous
adventures of a perfect English gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the
scenery of which is very well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as
a guide-book to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of
the same age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a
complete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took every
word of &quot;The Purple Land&quot; as literally as though it had been an R. G.
Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on the whole the
book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set him off. I did not
realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my
office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hello, Robert,&quot; I said. &quot;Did you come in to
cheer me up?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Would you like to go to South America, Jake?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You
can see all the South Americans you want in Paris anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They're not the real South Americans.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They look awfully real to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had a boat train to catch with a week's mail stories, and
only half of them written.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Do you know any dirt?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;None of your exalted connections getting
divorces?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses,
would you go to South America with me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with
two of us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;I like this town and I go to
Spain in the summer-time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;All my life I've wanted to go on a trip like
that,&quot; Cohn said. He sat down. &quot;I'll be too old before I can ever do
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Don't be a fool,&quot; I said. &quot;You can go
anywhere you want. You've got plenty of money.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I know. But I can't get started.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Cheer up,&quot; I said. &quot;All countries look just
like the moving pictures.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But I felt sorry for him. He had it badly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and
I'm not really living it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except
bull-fighters.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm not interested in bull-fighters. That's an
abnormal life. I want to go back in the country in South America. We could have
a great trip.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Did you ever think about going to British East Africa
to shoot?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No, I wouldn't like that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'd go there with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No; that doesn't interest me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's because you never read a book about it. Go on
and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black
princesses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I want to go to South America.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Come on down-stairs and have a drink.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Aren't you working?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; I said. We went down the stairs to the café
on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of
friends. Once you had a drink all you had to say was: &quot;Well, I've got to
get back and get off some cables,&quot; and it was done. It is very important
to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is
such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working.
Anyway, we went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked
at the bottles in bins around the wall. &quot;This is a good place,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There's a lot of liquor,&quot; I agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Listen, Jake,&quot; he leaned forward on the bar.
&quot;Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you're
not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you've lived nearly half the time
you have to live already?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, every once in a while.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll
be dead?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What the hell, Robert,&quot; I said. &quot;What the
hell.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm serious.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's one thing I don't worry about,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You ought to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I've had plenty to worry about one time or other. I'm
through worrying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, I want to go to South America.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn't make
any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving
from one place to another. There's nothing to that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But you've never been to South America.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;South America hell! If you went there the way you feel
now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don't you start
living your life in Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm sick of Paris, and I'm sick of the Quarter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself
and see what happens to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night
and nothing happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my
papers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Wasn't the town nice at night?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't care for Paris.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a
thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the
two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He
got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book
too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I've got to go up-stairs and
get off some cables.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Do you really have to go?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, I've got to get these cables off.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Do you mind if I come up and sit around the
office?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No, come on up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor
and Publisher and I worked hard for two hours. Then I sorted out the carbons,
stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and
rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went out into the other
room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big chair. He was asleep with his
head on his arms. I did not like to wake him up, but I wanted to lock the
office and shove off. I put my hand on his shoulder. He shook his head. &quot;I
can't do it,&quot; he said, and put his head deeper into his arms. &quot;I
can't do it. Nothing will make me do it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Robert,&quot; I said, and shook him by the shoulder.
He looked up. He smiled and blinked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Did I talk out loud just then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Something. But it wasn't clear.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;God, what a rotten dream!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Did the typewriter put you to sleep?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Guess so. I didn't sleep all last night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What was the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Talking,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the
bedroom scenes of my friends. We went out to the Café Napolitain to have
an&nbsp;<i>apéritif</i>&nbsp;and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.</p>
